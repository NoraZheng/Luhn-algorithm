  > Write a program that prompts the user for a credit card number and then reports (via printf) whether it is a valid American Express, MasterCard, or Visa card number, per the definitions of each’s format herein. For simplicity, you may assume that the user’s input will be entirely numeric.

  > American Express uses 15-digit numbers, MasterCard uses 16-digit numbers, and Visa uses 13- and 16-digit numbers. 

  > All American Express numbers start with 34 or 37; most MasterCard numbers start with 51, 52, 53, 54, or 55; and all Visa numbers start with 4.
